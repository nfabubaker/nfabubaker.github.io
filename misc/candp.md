-   **Project title:** Efficient Utilization-Migration VM Consolidation Technique for Cloud Datacenters   
    **During:** Cloud Computing course, 2016  
    **Description:** Abstract: many of the state-of-art researches and methodologies concentrated on enhancing the utilization of resources in cloud datacenters, such techniques might contribute also in enhancing the power consumption of the datacenter. VM migrations and consolidation are two methods have been used separately because of the sense that consolidating VMs in one PM should be free of SLA violations. Here in this paper we first prove that migrations can be forecasted if the underlying traffic pattern has been forecasted. Then we introduce and algorithm that combines both live migration and consolidation to improve both the energy consumption and resource utilization. This work is basically a continuing on a previous work about consolidating complementary VMs.
                    
                    
-   **Project title:**  Retrieval of Political Relations between Countries Using Sentiment Analysis  
    **During:** Information Retreival course, 2016  
    **Description:** ABSTRACT:  
              In the past few years, sentiment analysis and opinion mining
              become an initial issue for companies and governments to
              measure people's opinion through their blogging on the social
              media. So we thought why not use this idea for sensing political
              relations between countries and see if there is coming war or
              disturb in the relations. In this paper, we describe a methodology
              to retrieve the political relations between two countries based on
              sentiment analysis. We show how to retrieve, process and
              sentimentally analyses data from Twitter to measure the relations.
              We conduct some real world experiments and sensitivity analysis
              to increase the confident and robustness of our results.
                    
                    
-   **Project title:** Towards Efficient Storage and Fast Querying of Offshore Oil and Gas Fields Metocean  
    **During:** Advances in Data Management Research course, 2014  
    **Description:** Abstract: Advances in technology have enabled the production of massive volumes of valuable metocean data
              through both observations and simulations. On average, every
              ten minutes there are new measurements to be added to the
              database, resulting with a volume of hundreds of terabytes. Thus,
              this research intends to study the structure of metocean data
              aiming at finding a potential solution that can compress the data
              at real-time and maintain a space-efficient and fast retrieval
              database. It will also include performing experiments with a
              number of real metocean datasets, query sets, and parameters to
              show the effect that varying these characteristics has on analysis
              results.
               
                    
                    
-   **Project title:**  Smart Shopping Cart  
    **During:** Hardware Graduation Project (B.Sc.), 2014   
    **Description:** A shopping cart
              that follows you wherever you go inside the supermarket, you have to carry a small
              remote device with you so that the cart can follow you. After leaving it, the cart
              returns to its original location using indoor localization system.

    **Description:** ARIS is a studio used to facilitate the creation process of AR applications and exporting
              them to mobile extensions (android or iOS).
