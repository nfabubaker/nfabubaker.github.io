# Welcome / ÙŠØ§ Ù…Ø±Ø­Ø¨Ø§

I'm an [SNSF Postdoctoral Fellow][spfwp] at the [Scalable Parallel Computing Laboratory (SPCL)][spclwp], ETH ZÃ¼rich, advised by Prof. [Torsten Hoefler][htorwp]. I'm also an associated researcher with the [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/). I obtained my PhD degree in [Computer Engineering from Bilkent University][bilcswp] under the supervision of Prof. [Cevdet Aykanat][aykanatwp]. In my reasearch, I design **combinatorial algorithms** and methods for reducing data movement overheads in **parallel scientific and machine learning applications** running on HPC systems. These algorithms can be applied in shared-memory setting, e.g., reducing memory accesses or improving data locality, or in distributed-memory setting, e.g., reduce volume of communication and number of exchanged messages.

## Research Interests

***I specialize in designing efficient parallel algorithms for machine learning and scientific computing applications that are difficult to parallelize.***

- **Parallel & High-Performance Computing**
- **Sparse Computations, Iterative Solvers**
- **Sparse Tensor Decompositions** 
- **Graph/Hypergraph partitioning**
- **Sparse matrix reordering methods**
- **Machine Learning:** Graph & Hypergraph Neural Networks, Parallelizing LLMs

## Teaching

I was a teaching assistant for the following courses  @Bilkent University:

[ Year/Semester code (**XXZZ**): **XX** as in year 20XX; **YY**: FAll, SPring, SuMmer (or is it the second M?) ]
* CS473: Algorithms I. *(16FA, 17SP, 17FA, 18FA, 19SP, 19FA, 20SP, 20FA, [21SP][473-ud], [21FA][473])*
* CS458: Software Verification and Validation. *(20SP, 20SM)*
* CS101/2: Algorithms and Programming I/II. *(14FA, 15SP, 15FA, [17SM][102-17SM], 18SP)*. 
* CS201/2: Fundamental Structure of Computer Science I/II. *([15SM][201-15SM], [16SP][202-16SP], [16SM][201-16SM])*
* CS114: Introduction to programming for Engineers ( used to be a Java-based course, now replaced with CS115 which is a Python-based course). *(15SM, 16FA)*
* CS223: Digital Design. *(15FA, 16SP)*


I was ***an instructor*** for "Computer Architecture II" course remotely during the 2020-2021 Spring semester (pandemic times) @An-Najah National University.
