# Welcome / ÙŠØ§ Ù…Ø±Ø­Ø¨Ø§

I'm an [SNSF Postdoctoral Fellow][spfwp] at the [Scalable Parallel Computing Laboratory (SPCL)][spclwp], ETH ZÃ¼rich, advised by Prof. [Torsten Hoefler][htorwp]. I obtained my PhD degree from Bilkent University under the supervision of Prof. [Cevdet Aykanat][aykanatwp]. My research interests include Parallel Algorithms, High performance computing, efficient AI training, and graph/hypergraph partitioning.


## Research Interests

***I specialize in designing efficient parallel algorithms for machine learning and scientific computing applications that are difficult to parallelize.***

- **Parallel & High-Performance Computing**
- **Sparse Computations, Iterative Solvers**
- **Sparse Tensor Decompositions** 
- **Graph/Hypergraph partitioning**
- **Sparse matrix reordering methods**
- **Machine Learning:** Graph & Hypergraph Neural Networks, Parallel LLMs
