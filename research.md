I design **combinatorial algorithms** and methods for reducing data movement overheads in **parallel scientific and machine learning applications** running on HPC systems.
These algorithms can be applied in shared-memory setting, e.g., reducing memory accesses or improving data locality, or in distributed-memory setting, e.g., reduce volume of communication and number of exchanged messages.
